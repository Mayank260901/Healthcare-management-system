# Hospital Management System (CLI-Based)

## Overview

The **Hospital Management System** is a CLI-based Java application that facilitates the management of hospital operations such as managing patient records, doctor information, appointment scheduling, billing, and much more. It is built using **Java**, **JPA**, **Hibernate**, **MySQL**, and **Maven**. The application follows a modular structure using a **DAO layer**, **Service layer**, and incorporates **Exception Handling**, making it scalable and maintainable.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, update, and manage patient records, including basic information, medical history, and billing.
- **Doctor Management**: Register and manage doctor details, including specialization and availability.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule, update, and cancel appointments with validation to avoid conflicts.
- **Billing System**: Generate and manage bills for treatments and medications.
- **Audit Logging**: Track important actions taken in the system.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different views for Admin, Doctors, and Receptionists.
- **Feedback Management**: Collect and manage patient feedback for quality control.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)** for ORM
- **Hibernate** for database interaction
- **MySQL** as the relational database
- **Maven** for project management
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing
- **Log4J** for logging
- **JDBC** as a fallback for database interaction
- **CSV Export** for reporting

### Key Directories:
- **`app/`**: Main entry point for the application (`HospitalApp.java`).
- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files, such as Hibernate setup and backup service.
- **`dao/`**: DAO interfaces and implementations for managing database operations.
- **`exception/`**: Custom exception classes and a global exception handler.
- **`model/`**: Contains all entity classes and enums.
- **`service/`**: Service layer for business logic.
- **`util/`**: Utility classes like encryption and CSV export.
- **`view/`**: Role-based CLI views for interaction.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
1. **Java 11** or higher installed.
2. **MySQL** installed and running.
3. **Maven** installed for dependency management.
4. A database named `hospital_db` in MySQL.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-system.git
   cd hospital-management-system
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL database:**
   Update the MySQL credentials in the `src/main/resources/persistence.xml` file:
   ```xml
   <property name="hibernate.connection.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db"/>
   <property name="hibernate.connection.username" value="your-username"/>
   <property name="hibernate.connection.password" value="your-password"/>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Use Maven to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   You can run the main application using the following Maven command:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.hospital.app.HospitalApp"
   ```

### Database Initialization

- Tables are automatically generated using Hibernate’s `hbm2ddl` feature.
- Upon the first run, tables for `Appointment`, `Doctor`, `Patient`, etc., will be created.

## Testing

Unit tests for the DAO and Service layers are located in the `src/test/java/com/hospital/` directory. To run all tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

## Usage

Upon running the application, the user is presented with a **Role-Based Menu**:
- **Admin** can manage all entities (Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Billing, etc.).
- **Doctor** can view and manage appointments and patient details.
- **Receptionist** can schedule and cancel appointments, view doctor and patient data.

Example flow:

1. **Login** as Admin or Receptionist.
2. **Manage Doctors**: Add, update, or remove doctor details.
3. **Schedule Appointments**: Add new appointments, ensuring no time conflicts for doctors and patients.
4. **Generate Bills**: Create and view bills for patient treatments.

## Exception Handling

The system provides custom exception handling for:
- **Appointment conflicts**: Avoids scheduling overlapping appointments.
- **Authentication errors**: Ensures only authorized personnel access certain features.
- **General exceptions**: Managed by the `GlobalExceptionHandler` to ensure smooth operations without abrupt failures.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Integration**: Support for cloud-based databases and services for remote deployment.
- **Audit Reports**: Export and view activity logs for system audits.
- **Notification System**: Send appointment reminders and notifications to patients.
